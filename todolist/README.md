Note: The node_modules folder was too big to upload to github. To re-create this app, create a new react app* and replace the files in /public and /src with the ones in this repo.

*Steps to creating a new react app:
1. Download the latest version of Node.js.
2. Open Command Prompt.
3. Run npm install -g create-react-app.
4. In your command prompt, navigate to the folder you want to install the app and enter create-react-app todolist.
5. Navigate to that folder in file explorer.
6. Clear all the contents within the /public and /src folders.
7. Take the /public and /src folders within this repo drag them to your local todolist folder.
8. Return to your command prompt and enter npm start.
